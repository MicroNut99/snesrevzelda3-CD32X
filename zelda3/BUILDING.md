**Note (the Sega 32X port):** in this repository zelda3's sources are changed for the 32X and
compile only as C++ with the port's build. The PC build instructions below are upstream's and do not
work here - only making the assets (`python3 assets/restool.py --extract-from-rom`) still applies.
To build the game see [Building](../README.md#building) in the port's README (the steps, `build.sh
play|replay|test`, every switch). `assets/restool.py`'s switches are listed in
[README.md](README.md#building).

## Installing libraries on Linux/MacOS
1. Open a terminal
2. Install pip if not already installed

python3 -m ensurepip
```
3. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
```sh
git clone https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3
cd zelda3
```
4. Install requirements using pip
```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Install SDL2
* Ubuntu/Debian `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev`
* Fedora Linux `sudo dnf install SDL2-devel`
* Arch Linux `sudo pacman -S sdl2`
* macOS: `brew install sdl2` (you can get homebrew [here](https://brew.sh/))

## Compiling on Linux/MacOS
1. Place your US ROM file named `zelda3.sfc` in `zelda3`
2. Compile
```sh
make
```

Advanced make usage ...

```sh
make -j$(nproc) # run on all core
make clean all  # clear gen+obj and rebuild
CC=clang make   # specify compiler
```
</details>

## Nintendo Switch

You need [DevKitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) and [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) installed.

```sh
(dkp-)pacman -S git switch-dev switch-sdl2 switch-tools
cd platform/switch
make # Add -j$(nproc) to build using all cores ( Optional )
# You can test the build directly onto the switch ( Optional )
nxlink -s zelda3.nro
```

## More Compilation Help

Look at the wiki at https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3/wiki for more help.

The ROM needs to be named `zelda3.sfc` and has to be from the US region with this exact SHA256 hash
`66871d66be19ad2c34c927d6b14cd8eb6fc3181965b6e517cb361f7316009cfb`

In case you're planning to move the executable to a different location, please include the file `zelda3_assets.dat`.
